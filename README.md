# My-Portfolio

## Description 

This is my first project in terms of building something from scratch. This is a great starter site because it utlizes some basic and advanced CSS and HTML, which is the structure and the looks of basic web development. Even with these tools, one can build some complicated things. This portfolio is a great example of what you can do to show employers what you are capable of and what type of skills you can do. In the future, I plan on updating this page to include my actual project links and pictures. However for the time being, because I have no real coding project experience, these are the placeholder images and links that I will be using for now. 

In this basic portfolio page, I am showing the employer an about me page, a projects page, and a contact page. These will include images to make the page look prettier as well as some buttons at the top of the page to make this easily accessible. It is important to me that the pictures and the words are at a good size because it will be easily read and seen by employers. In the future, it will be good to add more animations as well.

## Installation

First, by cloning the repository down to your computer, you can copy down the existing index.html file. Next, open it up with GitBash and type in "code ." , which should open up VSCode. From there, there were a lot of errors and things that needed to be fixed, which will be went over in the next section.


## Usage 

From opening the first page, you will immediately be greeted with a picure of myself smiling. This is because the employers need to know who they are dealing with. In terms of coding, this was one of the first things in the code. As you can see, this is in the main section with id=h1block and being the first header. If you look at the CSS, you can see that all the header sizes were changed because I needed it to be bigger.

The next thing that stands out about this apge is the nav bar. From first glance, you'd think that they were just 3 regular nav sections. However, once you however over them, you'd see that you can click on them and that it would take you towards the desired section of the page. Furthermore, you can also see that if you hover over it, it forms a box around the words and it glows white. This is done possible by implementing psuedo classes in the css page. Once you create a pseudo class with the desired class, you can alter the effects of the class.

Now for the main part of the page, and the biggest portion of the website. As you can see when you scroll down, either with your mousewheel or by clicking the section buttons, you can see that you are greeted by three dogs. Again by first glance, it might seem like ordinary pictures of cute puppies. However, as you begin to hover your mouse over the picture or the words, you can see that these are actually clickable links that drives you towards my own personal projects.
